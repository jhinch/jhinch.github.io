Hi, my name is Jason Hinch. I am a software developer based in Sydney Australia. Since 2010, I have been working
at Atlassian in a number of engineering roles, including the software architect overseeing the cloud
identity platform for such products as Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket. I am now working as a Principal Engineer
developing new products for Software teams.
