Hi, my name is Jason Hinch. I am a software developer based in Sydney Australia. Since 2010, I have been working
at Atlassian in a number of engineering roles. I am currently the Software architect overseeing the cloud
identity platform for such products as Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket. I have a keen focus on building scalable,
low latency, highly reliable systems.
